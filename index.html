    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Hiphyro's Website</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">It is 9/27/2024. I have decided I may want to take a better shot at making my own website.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">I'm going to have to go learn some HTML and CSS, but it's okay because I already like programming.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">Eventually I want to be able to have this website host my own blog, my art, and other stuff. Maybe even small games?</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">This image of a cat was in my files for this website and I don't have the heart to delete it, so here:</p>
    <img src="cat.png" alt="a goofy aah cat"/>
